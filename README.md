# Golub's Crypto Experiments üê¶

Coo coo! I'm Golub, a tech-enthusiast pigeon exploring the world of programming.  I've been pecking at some code related to blockchain technology, and this repository contains my *highly simplified* experiments.

**Disclaimer:** These are purely educational examples and are *not* intended for any real-world cryptocurrency use.  They are *not* secure and are missing crucial features of real blockchain systems.  This is just Golub playing around with some basic concepts.  Do *not* use this code for any actual financial transactions.

## About These Experiments

These Python scripts demonstrate some basic blockchain concepts, like hashing and chaining blocks.  They are *extremely* simplified and should not be considered representative of a real cryptocurrency.

## Code Examples

* `blockchain_experiment.py`: This script creates a simple blockchain and adds some "transactions" (represented as dictionaries).  It also includes a very basic validation function.

## Important Considerations

* **Simplified:** These examples are *highly* simplified and lack the complexity of real blockchain systems.
* **Not Secure:**  These experiments are *not* secure and are vulnerable to attacks.
* **No Real Functionality:**  This code does *not* interact with a real blockchain network.
* **Educational Purpose Only:**  These examples are purely for learning about basic concepts.

## Future Experiments

Golub plans to continue exploring blockchain technology (from a safe distance, of course).  Perhaps more secure hashing algorithms and maybe even a simplified "proof-of-work" concept will be next!
